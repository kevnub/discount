                        <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">A vehicle purchased/leased under The Program must be used for the personal, noncommercial use/transportation of The Participant.

                        </p>
                        <p style="padding-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">

This prohibition does not apply to a fuel fill if provided by the dealer at the time of delivery.
                        </p>

                        During the initial dealer inventory buildup when new models are introduced, and from time to time thereafter, it may be necessary for GM to restrict purchase under The Program on certain models. Please go to gmsupplierdiscount.com to see a list of eligible vehicles.
                        <br><br>
                        The Program does not constitute an agreement between GM and any purchaser for the purchase/lease of any vehicle at a specific price. However, by purchasing a vehicle through The Program, The Participant and Sponsored Purchaser acknowledge The Program Rules and Guidelines and agree to abide by the same program Rules and Guidelines.
                        <br><br>
                        General Motors may unilaterally modify, change or withdraw The Program at any time.
                        <br><br>
                        Participants are required to report any unauthorized use immediately. Those who do not report any suspicious or unauthorized use of authorization numbers after they have been submitted on their behalf may be subject to the sanctions referenced in The Program Rules section.
                        <br><br>
                        Failure to comply with an audit request may subject The Participant to the consequences referenced in The Program Rules section. General Motors has the final decision on all eligibility requirements. The Rules and Guidelines of The Program may be modified by GM at any time, in its sole discretion.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><b>Compliance With Applicable Laws</b></p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">If any law or regulation is adopted or interpreted which, in GM's opinion, prohibits or penalizes the implementation of The Program, GM may, in its sole discretion, cancel The Program or any order submitted pursuant to The Program without any further obligation and without any liability to either the dealer or The Participant.
